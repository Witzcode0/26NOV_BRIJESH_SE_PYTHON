In C programming, an array is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations. Each element in the array is identified by an index or a key. The array provides a convenient way to store and access a group of values.

Declaration:
To declare an array, you specify the data type of its elements and the array's name, followed by the size of the array in square brackets.

Syntx :

dataType arrayName[arraySize];
int numbers[5];

Initialization:
You can initialize an array at the time of declaration or later during the program.

At the time of declaration:
int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};


After declaration:
int numbers[5];
numbers[0] = 1;
numbers[1] = 2;
numbers[2] = 3;
numbers[3] = 4;
numbers[4] = 5;


Accessing Elements:
Array elements are accessed using their indices (starting from 0). For example:
int value = numbers[2];  // Accesses the third element of the array (index 2)
