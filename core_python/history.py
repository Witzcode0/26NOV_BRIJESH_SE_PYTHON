"""
Python is a high-level, dynamically typed, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Here's a brief 

history of Python:

Creation (Late 1980s - Early 1990s): Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. He was looking to create a successor to the ABC programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasized code readability and simplicity.

First Release (1991): The first version of Python, Python 0.9.0, was released in February 1991. It included features like exception handling, functions, and modules.

Python 1.0 (1994): Python 1.0 was released in January 1994. This version included features like lambda, map, filter, and reduce.

Python 2.x Series (2000 - 2008): The Python 2.x series was introduced with Python 2.0 in October 2000. This series brought significant improvements, including garbage collection, Unicode support, and list comprehensions. The last version in the 2.x series was Python 2.7, released in July 2010. Python 2 was widely used for many years and is still found in legacy systems, but it reached its end of life in January 2020.

Python 3.x Series (2008 - Present): Python 3.0, also known as Python 3000 or Py3k, was released in December 2008. It was a significant overhaul of the language that aimed to fix inconsistencies and remove outdated features. Python 3 introduced changes such as Unicode support by default, improved integer division behavior, and syntax enhancements. However, due to backward compatibility issues, adoption of Python 3 was slower than anticipated. Subsequent versions of Python 3 brought further refinements and improvements.

Community Growth: Python's popularity grew steadily over the years, fueled by its simplicity, readability, and the vibrant Python community. It became widely used in various domains, including web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.

Recent Developments: Python continues to evolve with regular releases introducing new features, optimizations, and enhancements. Python's package ecosystem, including the Python Package Index (PyPI), provides access to a vast array of libraries and frameworks for various purposes.

Python Software Foundation: The Python Software Foundation (PSF), founded in 2001, serves as the organization behind Python. It promotes, protects, and advances Python programming language and its community. The PSF oversees the development and maintenance of Python and supports various Python-related projects and initiatives.
