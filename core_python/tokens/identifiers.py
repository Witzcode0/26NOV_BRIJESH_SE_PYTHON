In Python, an identifier is a name given to entities in the code such as variables, functions, classes, modules, or objects. Identifiers are used to uniquely identify these entities and enable programmers to refer to them in their code. Here are the key rules for forming valid identifiers in Python:

Allowed Characters: Identifiers can consist of alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and underscores (_). However, they cannot start with a digit.

Case Sensitivity: Python is case-sensitive, meaning uppercase and lowercase letters are distinct. Therefore, myVariable, MyVariable, and myvariable are considered different identifiers.

Reserved Words: Identifiers cannot be the same as Python's reserved words (also known as keywords), which are predefined and have special meanings in the language. Examples of reserved words include if, else, for, while, def, class, import, etc. You cannot use these words as identifiers.

Length: Identifiers can be of any length, but it's good practice to keep them meaningful and concise.

Convention: It's customary in Python to use descriptive names for identifiers, following the naming conventions described in PEP 8 (Python Enhancement Proposal). For example, variable names should be lowercase with words separated by underscores (snake_case), while class names should follow the CapWords convention (CamelCase).

White space are not allowed. First name, firstName, FirstName

Here are some examples of valid identifiers:
my_variable
myVariable
variable_1
ClassExample
function_name


And here are some examples of invalid identifiers:
3variable     # Cannot start with a digit
my-variable   # Hyphens are not allowed
if           # Reserved word
for          # Reserved word
import       # Reserved word
