"""
In Python, a keyword is a reserved word that has a special meaning and purpose within the language. These keywords are predefined and cannot be used as identifiers (such as variable names or function names). Python's keywords are used to define the syntax and structure of the language. These keywords are fundamental to writing code in Python and are used to define control flow, define functions and classes, handle exceptions, import modules, and more.

Welcome to Python 3.12's help utility!

If this is your first time using Python, you should definitely check out
the tutorial on the internet at https://docs.python.org/3.12/tutorial/.

Enter the name of any module, keyword, or topic to get help on writing
Python programs and using Python modules.  To quit this help utility and
return to the interpreter, just type "quit".

To get a list of available modules, keywords, symbols, or topics, type
"modules", "keywords", "symbols", or "topics".  Each module also comes
with a one-line summary of what it does; to list the modules whose name
or summary contain a given string such as "spam", type "modules spam".

Here is a list of the Python keywords.  Enter any keyword to get more help.

False               class               from                or
None                continue            global              pass
True                def                 if                  raise

await               finally             nonlocal            yield
break               for                 not

False: Represents the boolean value false.
class: Defines a new class.
from: Used to import specific attributes or functions from a module.
or: Used in logical expressions to evaluate as true if at least one operand is true.
None: Represents the absence of a value or a null value.
continue: Skips the rest of the current iteration of a loop.
global: Declares a variable as global, allowing it to be accessed from outside the current scope.
pass: Used as a placeholder where no action is required.
True: Represents the boolean value true.
def: Defines a new function.
if: Used to conditionally execute code.
raise: Raises an exception.
and: Used in logical expressions to evaluate as true if both operands are true.
del: Deletes a variable or an item from a collection.
import: Used to import modules into a Python script or program.
return: Returns a value from a function.
as: Used to create an alias for a module or an imported object.
elif: Short for "else if", used in conditional statements.
in: Checks if a value exists in a collection.
try: Defines a block of code to be tested for errors.
assert: Used for debugging purposes to assert that a condition is true.
else: Defines the block of code to be executed if the preceding condition(s) are false.
is: Checks if two variables refer to the same object.
while: Defines a loop that continues executing as long as a condition is true.
async: Declares a function as asynchronous, allowing it to be executed concurrently with other operations.
except: Defines a block of code to be executed if an error occurs in the corresponding try block.
lambda: Defines an anonymous function.
with: Used to simplify exception handling and resource management.
await: Used to pause the execution of an asynchronous function until a result is available.
finally: Defines a block of code to be executed regardless of whether an exception occurs.
nonlocal: Declares a variable as nonlocal, allowing it to be modified in an enclosing scope.
yield: Pauses the execution of a generator function and yields a value to the caller.
break: Exits the current loop prematurely.
for: Used to iterate over a sequence (e.g., list, tuple, dictionary).
not: Used to negate a boolean value.
