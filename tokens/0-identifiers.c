Identifiers
    - Identifiers are used to name variables, functions, classes, modules, and other objects. c has several rules and conventions for naming identifiers:

Rules of identifiers :

1] Valid Characters:
Identifiers can consist of letters (uppercase or lowercase)[a-zA-Z], digits[0-9], and underscores (_).

They must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_). They cannot start with a digit (0-9).

Example: 

level_1, _level_1 - true
1_level - false

2] Case Sensitivity:
c is case-sensitive. This means that uppercase and lowercase letters are treated as distinct characters. For example, 'myVar' and 'myvar' are considered different identifiers.

3] Reserved Words:
You cannot use c's reserved words (keywords) as identifiers. Examples of reserved words include if, else, while, for, class, structure, union and so on.

4]Length:
There is no strict limit on the length of an identifier, but it's recommended to keep them reasonably short and meaningful.

5]Underscores:
It is common to use underscores to separate words in longer identifiers, following the convention known as "snake_case." For example, my_variable, user_name, or calculate_average.

Example : first_name, last_name, c_to_f, k_to_f

6]CamelCase:
For class names, it is common to use CamelCase, also known as "CapitalizedWords." In this convention, each word within the identifier starts with a capital letter, and there are no underscores. For example, MyClass, EmployeeRecord.

FirstName, LastName, CToF, KToF

7] whitespace are not allowed
Example : first name, last name

8] Special symbol are not allowed instead of (_)
@,$, %, ^....
@molmeh
