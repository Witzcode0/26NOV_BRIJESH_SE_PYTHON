/*
A variable in C is a named memory location that stores data of a specific type.

Variables can be declared anywhere in a C program, but they must be used before they are declared.

The type of a variable determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
